## Crash Prank \(Updated\)


</div>

### Description

When a user starts the program, it will pop up saying that they will be installing a virus and will have two options. To install it or to cancel the setup wizard. There are two different paths that they will find, either by installing or cancel but they both end up saying they are deleting system files and crashing the computer making the screen go black for a few seconds.

After that there will be another screen saying that it is in fact a prank.

Updated: This adds a more realistic feel to it and fixed some minor problems.

There are still many things that can be improved such as hiding it from alt-ctrl-del and hiding the mouse cursor when the screen goes black.

However this will be the final version of Crash Prank and any future development will be made by other authors who were inspired by it.
 
### More Info
 
If you want to improve or edit in anyway, please provide feedback and tell me where I can find it as I would like to see a better done version.

You can do whatever you want with the code, except make it to harm anyone's computer as it is only a prank.

One side effect is that if the user closes the program by doing the alt-ctrl-del and closing it there then it will not work.
